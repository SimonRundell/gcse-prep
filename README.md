# GCSEPrep

An AI-powered GCSE revision app for **Maths, English Language and English Literature**, supporting **AQA, Edexcel (Pearson) and OCR** exam boards.

Built with React 18 + Vite 6 + PHP + MySQL. Questions are generated and marked by an AI provider of your choice (Anthropic Claude by default, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint); all content data is stored in MySQL and editable through a built-in admin panel.

> Created by Becky Hingston and Simon Rundell, Exeter College Faculty of ITDD.

## Features

### Study
- **Topic practice** — AI-generated exam-style questions for every topic, labelled with your board's exact paper reference, marks and assessment objectives
- **Examiner feedback** — answers marked against board-style mark schemes with AO breakdown, improvement tips and a model answer
- **Mock Exam** — a mixed paper across all three subjects
- **Real Paper Mode** — works through the structure of AQA Nov 2024 Foundation Paper 1 (27 slots, 80 marks), generating fresh questions each time
- **Question Bank** — 100+ ready-made practice questions, filterable by topic with self-marking
- **Rich text answers** — all student answer boxes use a TipTap editor with bold, italic, underline, headings, code, subscript, superscript, horizontal rule and undo/redo, so working with indices and powers is straightforward

### Games
- **Flashcards** — flip-card decks from the question bank or AI-generated for any subject
- **Speed Round** — as many questions as possible in 60 seconds
- **Beat the Examiner** — climb the Grade 1 to 9 ladder with multiple-choice questions and 3 lives
- **Word Scramble** — unscramble key GCSE vocabulary
- **Match-Up** — connect terms to definitions
- **Leaderboard** — personal bests stored in the browser

### Video Lessons
Curated links to the best free GCSE YouTube channels (Corbettmaths, Maths Genie, Cognito, Mr Bruff, Mr Salles, and more) with topic chips that jump straight to relevant searches.

### Admin Panel
A protected admin panel (accessed via the gear icon in the top-right of the header) provides full CRUD management of all content:
- Question bank entries
- Vocabulary words
- Video channels and topics
- Exam blueprint (Real Paper Mode question slots)
- Board configuration and spec data

Editing niceties: list ordering is drag-and-drop (persisted to the database, no visible sort-order field), channel icons are picked from a Font Awesome dropdown, colours use a picker that resolves to `rgba()` values, and prose fields (video descriptions, word clues) use the same TipTap rich text editor as the student screens.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Node.js | 18 or later |
| npm | 9 or later |
| PHP | 8.1 or later |
| MySQL / MariaDB | 8.0 / 10.6 or later |
| Apache (or nginx) | with PHP-FPM |

> The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to Apache on `localhost:80`. Apache must be running alongside `npm run dev`.

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonRundell/gcse-prep.git
cd gcse-prep
npm install
```

### 2. Configure

Copy the example config and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .config.example.json .config.json
```

`.config.json` (never commit this file):

```json
{
  "db": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "name": "gcse_prep",
    "user": "your_db_user",
    "password": "your_db_password"
  },
  "ai": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "endpoint": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "apiKey": "sk-ant-..."
  }
}
```

#### AI provider options

The `ai` block selects which LLM generates and marks questions. No code changes are needed to switch provider:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `provider` | `"anthropic"` (Messages API) or `"openai"` (chat-completions format, used by OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, Ollama and most others) |
| `endpoint` | Full URL of the chat endpoint |
| `model` | Model ID as the provider expects it |
| `apiKey` | Sent as `x-api-key` (anthropic) or `Authorization: Bearer` (openai) |

Example for a local Ollama model on the same machine:

```json
"ai": {
  "provider": "openai",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions",
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "apiKey": "ollama"
}
```

Note that question generation relies on the model returning clean JSON; smaller local models do this less reliably than Claude, so expect more "Error generating question" retries with them.

### 3. Create the database

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE gcse_prep CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
mysql -u root -p gcse_prep < database/schema.sql
```

`schema.sql` creates all tables and inserts all seed data (question bank, vocabulary, video channels, exam blueprint, board configuration, and a default admin account).

Grant your app user access:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON gcse_prep.* TO 'your_db_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

> **Default admin account** created by the seed data:
>
> - Email: `admin@yourdomain.ac.uk`
> - Password: `gc5ERe51oN!`
>
> Log in to the admin panel and change these credentials immediately after first run.

### 4. Point Apache at the project

Add a virtual host or alias so Apache serves the project root. The simplest approach on a local machine is a symlink:

```bash
sudo ln -s /path/to/gcse-prep /var/www/html/gcse-prep
```

The PHP files must be reachable at `http://localhost/api/*.php` for Vite's proxy to work.

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `admin_users` | Admin accounts (bcrypt-hashed passwords) |
| `question_bank` | Practice questions with slot, topic, marks, answer |

---

## API Endpoints

### Public (no auth required)

| Method | URL | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/ai.php` | Proxy to the configured LLM provider for question generation and marking |
| `GET` | `/api/resources.php?type=<type>` | Fetch content data (questions, words, videos, blueprint, boards) |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/scores.php` | Read and write leaderboard scores |
| `GET` | `/api/admin_auth.php` | Check admin session status and whether an admin account exists |

### Admin (session required for writes)

| Method | URL | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/admin_auth.php` | `action: login` / `logout` / `setup` |
| `POST` | `/api/resources.php?type=<type>` | Create a resource record |
| `PUT` | `/api/resources.php?type=<type>&id=<id>` | Update a resource record |
| `DELETE` | `/api/resources.php?type=<type>&id=<id>` | Delete a resource record |

---

## Admin Panel

Click the ADMIN link (top right) to open the admin panel. On first run, if no admin account exists, you will be prompted to create one. Subsequent visits show a login form. The admin panel renders full-screen within the SPA; use the **← App** button to return to the student view without logging out.

The admin panel provides tabbed CRUD for: Questions, Words, Videos, Blueprint, Boards, and Admin Users. Board data is edited as raw JSON (the boards table stores complex nested spec and subject data in a JSON column); the board colour has its own picker.

Rows in the Questions, Words, Videos and Blueprint tables are reordered by dragging the grip handle; the new order is saved automatically. In the Questions tab, clear the filter box before dragging (reordering a filtered subset is disabled).

---

## Development

```bash
npm run dev       # Start Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build     # Production build to /dist
npm run preview   # Preview the production build
npm run doctor    # Run react-doctor code quality checks
```

Icons are served from Font Awesome 6 Free (loaded via cdnjs CDN in `index.html`). No icon library is installed as an npm dependency. All UI iconography uses Font Awesome classes; no raw emoji characters appear in the interface.

Rich text editing uses TipTap 3 (`@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`, plus the subscript and superscript extensions).

---

## Version History

### 0.1.5

#### Single-page application

- Removed the `/admin` URL route. The admin panel is now rendered entirely within the root page via React state (`currentScreen === 'admin'`), eliminating the routing issues that affected live deployments. The gear icon in the header opens it; the **← App** button returns to the student view.

#### Admin Users tab
- Logged-in admins can now perform full CRUD on the `admin_users` table from a new **Admin Users** tab in the dashboard.
- Create: email + password (min 8 characters) with confirmation field.
- Edit: email always editable; password field is optional (blank = keep existing hash).
- Delete: blocked if the target is the currently logged-in account, or if it is the last remaining admin.
- Server-side validation and bcrypt hashing on all write operations.

#### Navigation overhaul
- Replaced the sidebar with a single sticky horizontal navbar containing five hover-activated dropdown groups: Maths, English Language, Literature, Revision and Games.
- Each group uses its own accent colour; the active item and group are highlighted.
- Logo image added to the left of the GCSEPrep wordmark; clicking it returns to the home screen.

#### Responsive / mobile design
- **Mobile navigation drawer** — a hamburger button (☰) appears in the header on screens ≤ 768 px. Tapping it opens a slide-in drawer from the left listing all nav groups and their items with large touch-friendly tap targets. The drawer closes on item selection, on backdrop tap, or via the ✕ button.
- **Exam board selector** — moved into the mobile drawer footer so the header stays uncluttered on small screens.
- **Logo** — scales from 150 px to 72 px on mobile to prevent header overflow.
- **Leaderboard** — Game and Date columns are hidden on mobile, keeping a clean Rank / Name / Score layout.
- **Word Scramble** — display word font size reduced from `2.8 rem` to `2 rem` with tighter letter-spacing to prevent horizontal overflow on narrow viewports.
- **Flashcard** — card height reduced from 280 px to 220 px on mobile.

#### CSS formatting
- `src/styles/main.css` reformatted so every CSS property declaration sits on its own line, making the stylesheet easier to read and edit during development. No style values were changed.

#### Database
- `database/backup_gcse.sql` made MySQL-compatible by removing MariaDB-specific conditional comment syntax (`/*M!999999\-...*/` and `/*M!100616...*/`), which caused a SQL 1064 parse error on plain MySQL imports.

---

### 0.1.3
- Improved menu and logo
- Replaced every raw emoji in the UI with Font Awesome 6 icons (buttons, titles, games, board picker, video channel avatars)
- Added a reusable TipTap rich text editor (bold, italic, underline, H1/H2, code, subscript, superscript, horizontal rule, undo/redo) to all student answer boxes; answers are submitted to the marker as HTML so indices and powers are preserved
- Admin: TipTap editing for video descriptions and word clues; Font Awesome icon dropdown; rgba colour pickers (channel background and board colour); drag-and-drop row ordering with the sort-order field hidden
- Moved the AI endpoint into `.config.json` (`ai` block: provider, endpoint, model, apiKey), supporting Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers, including local Ollama
- Database migration `migrate_video_icons.sql`: `video_channels.emoji` renamed to `icon` and widened; `boards.color` widened for rgba values
- Accessibility and quality pass with react-doctor: explicit `type="button"` on all buttons, aria labels on reorder controls, reduced wasted re-renders during drags
- Fixed crashes from stale `QUESTION_BANK` and `AQA_1F_BLUEPRINT` references in the Question Bank and Real Paper screens

### 0.1.1
- Web fonts and admin backend (MySQL-backed content with CRUD panel at `/admin`)

### 0.1.0
- Initial release
